For over a month I'm in this stock trading WhatsApp group. There is a mentor 'Peter' and an assistant. There is a private Equity stock competition, which Peter is partaking. The website states that Goldman Sachs is the organizer. He has been sharing good information, and also very on-point trading signals.\\n\\nIn the first round we could vote every 6 hr for peter. (Website in title) Also he starts giving insider stock tips. I see alot of people sharing screenshots making good profit. Peter says if you want to trade with the insider stocks, I must message him and make a Maxcor account. Peter says its from Maxcor Finance Group. Peter wins and goes to the next round, semi finals of the competition. Voting is now different, he shares a inside stock, gives buy/sell signals, and the % of profits are the votes. I actually made a Maxcor account, after doing way too little research. I send btc to it, followed Peters signals and actually make a good profit. I got suspicious when I tried to find more information.\\n\\nI've found that Maxcor finance group fused with BGC group decades ago. I've found nothing about the whole competition. The information video in the gppsvote link seems fake with a weird robotic AI voice.  I texted other members of the group who seemed like they were real, they thanked me for warning but believes its real for various reasons and continuing making profits\\n\\nthe thing is, I also easily got my btc and the profit back from the website. I tried sending btc back and forth again, made good profits again. Every time my btc returned safe and sound. \\n\\n\\nCould it be a scam in Ponzi fraude style?where everyone is winning and gaining more profits, sending more btc, and one day it all disappears? Thing is, the insider stock signals are all very real. The stocks so exist, and have the value history like on the maxcor account. Real profits.\\n The people in the whatsapp group are still doing it, and their profits are raking in. \\n\\nCould it be real and that I'm missing out? Tbh I feel some FOMO after seeing todays profits.\\n\\nOr smart for me to quit? \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not_spam\",\n          \"spam\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For over a month I'm in this stock trading WhatsApp group. There is a mentor 'Peter' and an assistant. There is a private Equity stock competition, which Peter is partaking. The website states that Goldman Sachs is the organizer. He has been sharing good information, and also very on-point trading signals.\\n\\nIn the first round we could vote every 6 hr for peter. (Website in title) Also he starts giving insider stock tips. I see alot of people sharing screenshots making good profit. Peter says if you want to trade with the insider stocks, I must message him and make a Maxcor account. Peter says its from Maxcor Finance Group. Peter wins and goes to the next round, semi finals of the competition. Voting is now different, he shares a inside stock, gives buy/sell signals, and the % of profits are the votes. I actually made a Maxcor account, after doing way too little research. I send btc to it, followed Peters signals and actually make a good profit. I got suspicious when I tried to find more information.\\n\\nI've found that Maxcor finance group fused with BGC group decades ago. I've found nothing about the whole competition. The information video in the gppsvote link seems fake with a weird robotic AI voice.  I texted other members of the group who seemed like they were real, they thanked me for warning but believes its real for various reasons and continuing making profits\\n\\nthe thing is, I also easily got my btc and the profit back from the website. I tried sending btc back and forth again, made good profits again. Every time my btc returned safe and sound. \\n\\n\\nCould it be a scam in Ponzi fraude style?where everyone is winning and gaining more profits, sending more btc, and one day it all disappears? Thing is, the insider stock signals are all very real. The stocks so exist, and have the value history like on the maxcor account. Real profits.\\n The people in the whatsapp group are still doing it, and their profits are raking in. \\n\\nCould it be real and that I'm missing out? Tbh I feel some FOMO after seeing todays profits.\\n\\nOr smart for me to quit? \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not_spam\",\n          \"spam\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Advertised as \\\"*brand new, clearance sale*\\\" for almost MSRP ($499). I intended to buy it from an official retailer first but local store only had one color/capacity combo available, so I took my chances.\\n\\nPhone came with dents and a degraded battery (91%) so it's clearly used. I contacted the seller, they immediately recognized there was a mistake in what they shipped and agreed to a return (this is strange since the seller doesn't advertise used phones for sale, only new and open box). But anyway, a return would be fine. Problem is, I'm out on a business trip and will not be able to ship it back on time. I contacted the seller firstly to let them know about their mistake and secondly to try to come to an arrangement and refund me at least as if the phone was refurbished which to me seems like an acceptable compromise (take \\\\~$150 off). The most they were willing to reimburse me was $20, which honestly felt like an insult.\\n\\nI'm stopping short of calling this a scam, but I couldn't find a better place to warn you about this seller or similar listings. I posted negative feedback which the seller promptly requested eBay to remove, so they still show 100% positive feedback. I'm suspicious that a lot of sellers try to pull this trick by selling used phones that at a quick glance appear near mint and to the average joe will likely pass as brand new so they charge almost MSRP for something that you can get for a lot less from, say: Backmarket.\\n\\nI know that sellers also suffer a lot from scammers and overall shitty people, but **qubocell** acknowledged they shipped me the wrong phone, so they surely can see in their inventory an extra \\\"new\\\" phone and a missing \\\"used\\\" one.\\n\\nI know I'm SOL, but are my expectations as a buyer unrealistic?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70gthkmg32b91.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3195dc31a707b7b480faf0cf9240987bb2525fc\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6zv6bih32b91.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b06c370d18319fc8cf0681ef37d933c97c9f541\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hokboa1i32b91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b30f6c9458de8774e4c78678c3493326d1966d2\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not_spam\",\n          \"spam\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
